## Ths script makes Mastodon a bit nicer.

#### Version 0.4:

Colorizes some elements:
– most of the links
– the "NOTES" text below the account name in the right-most column
– the Publish button and the [Un]Follow button
– all messages that were sent privately
– the active lists in the dialog where you add a user to (or remove from) a list
To specify your preferred colors in the script, see the initial lines, beginning with line 20.

Replaces the publish button's label "Veröffentlichen!" by the text "Trööt!"
(This is done for German language, only.)

Adds a quick-access button (showing an 'L') below the user name in the right-most column.
By clicking this button you can quickly open your list of lists, for adding this user to a list, or removing from a list.
The button saves you some time: No need to click the menu button and then select the entry from the menu.
Note:
This is still not a 1.0 release, but an incomplete version, that's why as of yet the 'L' button is working for a few languages only: English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Ukrainian. If you have activated another language, the button exists, but it does nothing.
